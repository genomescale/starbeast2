# StarBEAST2

StarBEAST2 is a new method for multispecies coalescent inference of species
trees and other phylogenetic parameters. It is more than 10 times faster
than \*BEAST, the method it replaces. It also introduces species tree relaxed
clocks, which apply a separate substitution rate to each branch of the species
tree. This enables accurate estimates of between-species molecular clock rates.

Before running StarBEAST2, it is a good idea to complete the latest [tutorial](https://github.com/genomescale/starbeast2/releases/download/v0.14.0/StarBEAST2-tutorial.zip). The tutorial
covers setting up and analysing the results of different kinds of StarBEAST2 analyses using an
example data set.
